# TRIPTRAN

This repository contains our work for the final project of the course 
Semantic Web Technology of the MA Information Science program, taught at the
 University of Groningen.
 
The goal of our application is to translate RDF (Resource Description Framework)
 triples to natural language. The **Triple Translator** (also known as **TRIPTRAN**)
 takes a single RDF triple as input and translates it to English.
